# SUPERVISED LEARNING

Supervised learning is the most common subbranch of machine learning today. Typically,
new machine learning practitioners will begin their journey with supervised learning algorithms.
Therefore, the first of this three post series will be about supervised learning.

Supervised machine learning algorithms are designed to learn by example. The name “supervised” learning
originates from the idea that training this type of algorithm is like having a teacher supervise the whole process.

When training a supervised learning algorithm, the training data will consist of inputs paired with the correct outputs.
During training, the algorithm will search for patterns in the data that correlate with the desired outputs. After training,
a supervised learning algorithm will take in new unseen inputs and will determine which label the new inputs will be classified
as based on prior training data. The objective of a supervised learning model is to predict the correct label for newly
presented input data.
