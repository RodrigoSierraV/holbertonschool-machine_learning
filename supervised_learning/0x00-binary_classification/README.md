# Binary Classification

Binary classification problems (Duda et al. 2001) consider assigning an individual to one of two categories,
by measuring a series of attributes. An example is medical diagnosis for a single medical condition
(say disease vs. no disease) based on a battery of tests. Again the action space has two elements:
(say a1: ‘diagnosis of disease’ and a0: ‘diagnosis of no disease’).

A typical situation occurs when the DM observes data on the attributes x and correct disease classification y of a sample
of individuals, and wishes to classify an additional individual, randomly drawn from the same population.
