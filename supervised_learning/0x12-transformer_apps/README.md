Machine translation is in demand within the enterprise environment. Itâ€™s vital
that global companies are able to share documents, notes, emails, and other
texts with people across the world in a gamut of different languages.

Arguably even more important is the need to democratize information alongside
globalization. Regardless of your spoken language, you should have access to
the same open source publications, healthcare info, tools, and knowledge as
those whose primary language is widely spoken, like English.
